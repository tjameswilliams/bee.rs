  <p>Next up; it is time to manifest your beers. Here you will enter
		all beers in your tasting party and will be given a unique ID to put on
		each beer. This will keep the beers anonymous to everyone!<br />
		<br />
		<strong>The steps:</strong>
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click 'Add a Beer'.</li>
		<li>Enter the beer's brewery, name and type.</li>
		<li>Take the unique ID and place it on the beer. (We suggest putting the beer
			in the bag to mask the bottle, but we'll leave that up to you.)</li>
		<li>Click 'Done' and go to the next beer until you are done!</li>
	</ol>
